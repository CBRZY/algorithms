# Algorithms in Dart

### Structure
main.dart can be found in [bin](https://github.com/DigitalCapitan/algorithms/tree/main/bin)<br>
The main method is used to call all algorithms and display time it takes to execute each method<br>

Source code of the algorithms can be found in [lib](https://github.com/DigitalCapitan/algorithms/tree/main/lib)<br>
List of all challenges are below<br>

Tests for all methods can be found in [test](https://github.com/DigitalCapitan/algorithms/tree/main/test)<br>
